How to use TypeORM API to interact with MySQL database
First import the Entities(Tables) and AppDataSource form file src

1. INSERT INTO
    Just use new to create a new object 
EX: Const Users = new User() - Table
    Then just use the attribute to define the data 
EX: Users.Name = 'Tuan' - Name is the attribute of User
    Finally save it by Entity manager with this code
EX: await AppDataSource.manager.save(Users)

2. SELECT FROM
    Before using SELECT, first create Repositories with Entities
EX: const UserRepositories = AppDataSource.getRepository(User)
    After that, depend on searched data we can use code: 
    1. Find first object have match the category:
        const firstUser = await UserRepositories.findOneby({id: 1})
    2. Find all object in the Entities
        const Users = await UserRepositories.find()
    3. Find data match the category
        const CodingUser = await UserRepositories.findBy({work: Coding})
    4. Find all object in the Entities and count the number
        const [Users, UsersCount] = await UserRepositories.findAndCount()

3. DELETE FROM
    First, search the data which is needed to delete 
EX: const firstUser = await UserRepositories.findOneby({id: 1})
    Then use code remove to delete it 
EX: await UserRepositories.remove(firstUser)

4. UPDATE
    First, search the data which is needed to delete 
EX: const firstUser = await UserRepositories.findOneby({id: 1})
    Then change the attribute which needed to update 
EX: firstUser.work = Sleeping
    Save it agian = Update the data
EX: await AppDataSource.manager.save(Users)
